**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
A project tracking system assists you to recognize all of the tasks that are required to complete your project successfully on time. 
That is why it is recommended to be deployed during planning phase of a project to control and regulate the allocated resources. 
It provides a fully automated monitoring, and evaluation system of financial requests by simply tracking planned, actual and modified expenditures to information system accounts. 
The project tracking system provides a highly-standarized, automated technique of budget and planning management across a diverse group of activities.

**IDEA DESCRIPTION**
A software tool is useful even before the execution phase of a project. During planning, it can help you manage the resources you’ll need to complete the tasks.
Once you’re in the monitoring and control stage of your project, the software really kicks in, allowing you to see if your actual progress matches where you planned to be at that time.
Using a project tracking software is essential to manage any project. It gives you a tool to control the triple constraint of time, cost and scope. 
Managers know when tasks are completed and that they’re not sucking up more than the allocated costs and resources.
